				<center><p6> One of the projects the juniors and seniors had to do was design and create an interactive
				<br>
				</br>
				website of their choice that shows their personal interest in. before they even started coding 
				<br>
				</br>
				their website the had to do the first set with was drawing wireframes. The wireframes are very
				<br>
				</br>
				useful since you’re setting up how your page/pages will look along with where exactly they’re 
				<br>
				</br>
				going to be placed on your page. During the wireframe stage the students would split up their 
				<br>
				</br>
				page using divs to section off where each piece of content is going to be placed. After getting
				<br>
				</br>
				feedback about their layout that’s when they were able to start creating their pages. The
				<br>
				</br>
				students had to use the 3 main languages of website making. The 3 languages were HTML,
				<br>
				</br>
				CSS,and javaScript. They used the program Notepad ++ to code everything. With the help of
				<br>
				</br>
				using these 3 languages the students were able to produce their final products some which are
				<br>
				</br>
				shown on this page.</p6></center>
